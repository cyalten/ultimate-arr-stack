# Remove stuck/stalled items from Sonarr and Radarr download queues
#
# Torrents frequently stall (dead seeders, stuck metadata, failed imports)
# and sit in queues indefinitely. This script identifies stuck items,
# removes them (with blocklist to prevent re-grabbing the same release),
# and triggers fresh searches for better alternatives.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/queue-cleanup.sh                # dry run (default)
#   ./scripts/queue-cleanup.sh --apply        # actually remove stuck items
#   ./scripts/queue-cleanup.sh --apply -v     # remove with verbose output
#
# Cron (Thursday 2am):
#   0 2 * * 4 $NAS_STACK_DIR/scripts/queue-cleanup.sh --apply >> $NAS_STACK_DIR/logs/queue-cleanup.log 2>&1
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Sonarr and Radarr running and accessible on localhost
#   - python3 and curl available
#
# What gets removed:
#   - Downloads stalled with no connections
#   - Torrents stuck downloading metadata
#   - Failed imports (completed but can't import)
#   - Downloads with errors (missing files, not available, etc.)
#   - Items at 0% progress for more than 24 hours
#
# What is NEVER removed:
#   - Items with any download progress (even if slow)
#   - Healthy downloads (trackedDownloadStatus == "ok" with progress)
#   - Downloads waiting for a manual import because Sonarr/Radarr matched
#     them by ID. These are good files; the report lists them instead.
#
# After removal, a fresh search is triggered for each affected
# series (Sonarr) or movie (Radarr) to find better-seeded releases.
#
# ⚠️  This script was generated with LLM assistance and human-reviewed.
#     Read and understand it before running. Do not execute scripts you
#     don't understand on your system. Dry run (no --apply) is the default
#     so you can inspect what it would do first.
